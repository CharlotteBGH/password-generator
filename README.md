# Password Generator
## Description
For this task, I had to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on selected criteria. 
This criteria included: 

* **Generation of a password when the button is clicked**

* **A series of prompts for password criteria**:
Length of password: At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
Character types: Lowercase, Uppercase, Numeric, Special characters ($@%&*, etc.)

* **Code to validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected**
* **Once all prompts are answered, the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page**

## Usage
To test the password generator, try entering a number that is below 8 (to show it will not create a password) and a number that is 8 or above (to generate a password).
